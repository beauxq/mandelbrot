## WebAssembly build notes

If you want to build without WebAssembly, there are some comments to change at the top of WADrawer.ts, then `npx webpack`

I made a renderer in WebAssembly, but it's not better than rendering in JavaScript until Firefox fixes OffscreenCanvas.
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=801176
So it's disabled.

build scripts use emsdk installed with these instructions: https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html

`drawWasm.ts` is automatically generated by build script in `wasm`

`build-dev.sh` and `build-prod.sh` will run that before the rest of the build process
